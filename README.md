# FFTGestureRecognition

# Gesture Recognition Using Simulated Radar Data (MATLAB)

This project simulates radar-based gesture recognition using synthetic signals in MATLAB. It focuses on classifying different gestures by analyzing their frequency content using signal processing techniques. The goal is to replicate tasks found in automotive applications, such as driver gesture recognition or proximity detection for car access systems.

## üëã Simulated Gestures

| Gesture | Description                             | Frequency Behavior |
|---------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Wave    | Gentle hand wave                        | Low frequency (<2 Hz) |
| Push    | Quick forward push                      | Medium frequency (2‚Äì4 Hz) |
| Swipe   | Fast horizontal motion                  | High frequency (>4 Hz) |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Signal Generation:**  
   Simulates each gesture using noisy sine waves and frequency-modulated components.

2. **Feature Extraction (FFT):**  
   Calculates the dominant frequency in each signal using Fast Fourier Transform.

3. **Classification:**  
   Maps frequency peaks to gesture labels using thresholds:
   - < 2 Hz ‚Üí Wave  
   - 2‚Äì4 Hz ‚Üí Push  
   - > 4 Hz ‚Üí Swipe

4. **Output:**  
   The program prints the classified gesture for each synthetic signal.
